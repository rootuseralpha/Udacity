[Udacity Linear algebra refresher course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud953) as a "pre-requisite" to do
[Udacity's Machine Learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).

- To avoid syntax errors when completing the assignments copy-paste the vectors, lines and planes in [OBJECTS_USED_IN_TESTS.md](https://github.com/omarrayward/Linear-Algebra-Refresher-Udacity/blob/master/OBJECTS_USED_IN_TESTS.md) used in them.

- To follow the course explanation with my own notes go to [NOTES.md](https://github.com/omarrayward/Linear-Algebra-Refresher-Udacity/blob/master/NOTES.md)

- I also found a couple of [bugs](https://github.com/omarrayward/Linear-Algebra-Refresher-Udacity/blob/master/NOTES.md#bugs-in-the-course) in the course.
